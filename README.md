# Escape From Humans

Basic mini 3D Game

## Theme

You came to invade the world, but you realized that people are crazier than you. You are trying to escape from the world, but the military is after you.

I made a simple damage control system. If you hit one of the Rocket side boosters, they will not bursting.
I added police and helicopter sounds. Increases or decreases the volume according to the distance.
